# Data Exploration & Visualisation


Data analysis is a fundamental tool in quantitative research, but when faced with a big, messy dataset it can be difficult to know how to get started.

In this workshop, we will look at some basic techniques for getting data into a usable format and exploring it visually in order to formulate suitable questions and find the answers. We will also explore some of the principles behind good data visualisation practice when communicating results to others in reports or presentations.

The workshop will include a lot of hands-on practice using the Orange data science environment. No experience of programming is required.

The following topics will be covered:

- What is exploratory data analysis?
- Getting data into a usable format.
- Visualising distributions.
- Dealing with outliers and missing values.
- Exploring variation and covariation. 
- Graphics for communication.


The *solutions* folder contains an example of an Orange workflow that can reproduce the data analysis described in the slides. 

NB: For this to work, you will need to locate the appropriate .csv files by double-clicking on each CSV file import widget.
